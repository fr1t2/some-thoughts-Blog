This Blog is starting out as a place to put my ideas, thoughts and feelings. I suppose it's much like most blogs in this way. I hope to provide something that is useful to another person. Use the info here carefully, as I can't truthfully recommend anyone attempt these things with out adult supervision.  If anything these pages and Blog posts help me to remember what the hell I did. After all, the most commonly heard phrase around me is "What the hell did you do?" 

Here are **Some Thoughts** towards that.

We make up just me, plain old me out here on this box, hollering at all the people. Someone said it looks much like the void, I refuse to agree.
