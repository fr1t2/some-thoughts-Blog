This guy is going to be the next big deal. A good friend of mine seeking to fulfill his dreams of being an entertainer and expressing his thoughts through music. 

For years he has slaved away to realize his dreams in kitchens, service jobs and various shit jobs. Certainly time that he sees some light in this long dark tunnel he has been walking. He released his first album a few years ago, and has been working hard writing new songs, recording music videos and pushing himself to become the change he needs in the world.
