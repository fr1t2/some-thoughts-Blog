Merkle Tree was started out of my interest into cryptography, cypher and the advances of privacy in the face of oppression. This will be the jumping off point for the next chapter in my life. 

With the advances in technology, politics and oppressive regimes, its now more important than ever for open communication protocols that allow the continued free trade of information. Pushing research, development and industry adoption of the best practice and security. 


I strongly believe you must be the change you want too see in the world.
